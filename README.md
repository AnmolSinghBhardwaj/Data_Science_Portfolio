# Data Science Portfolio
Data Science Portfolio of Anmol Singh Bhardwaj


[Project #1 (Master Thesis): Music Segment Boundary Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/AnmolSinghBhardwaj/EDA_Chelsea)

* Automatic detection of instrument, key, and tempo changes in music tracks

* Development of a CNN with multi-output heads for different musical dimensions

* Integration of SMS-EMOA (evolutionary multi-objective optimization) to optimize feature and model parameters

* Experimentation with raw features (MFCC, Chroma) vs. SSLM-enhanced features

* Implementation of weighted loss and negative sampling to improve rare boundary detection

* Evaluation on ~3000 songs, reporting precision, recall, and F1 per boundary type

* Framework built with Python, PyTorch, Pymoo, and Librosa

[Project #3: Breast Cancer Prediction](https://github.com/AnmolSinghBhardwaj/BreastCancer_Prediction)
* A classification modell wether a tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign(non-cancerous).
* Data is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/breast-cancer-dataset?resource=download
* The machine learning algorithm is a logistic regression
